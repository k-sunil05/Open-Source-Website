#  React Portfolio Site for an Open Source Organisation 

A responsive and scalable website built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, featuring a dynamic projects section powered by the GitHub API. Designed with a focus on SEO optimization and performance, the site supports diverse content such as blogs, events, and open-source project showcases.

---

##  Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes and display lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
You can learn more about testing in React [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.  
The build is minified, and filenames include content hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `npm run eject`

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back!  
This command exposes the build configuration (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) so you can customize it.
